        <p><strong>Data protection declaration</strong></p>

        <p>Thank you for visiting the Media Verification Assistant website. We pay a lot of attention to

            protecting your personal data. This data protection declaration sets out the method, extent and

            purpose of our collection, processing and use of your personal data.</p>

        <p><strong>Basic principles</strong></p>

        <p>We collect, process and use your personal data in compliance with the applicable data protection

            regulations. Personal data refers to all individual pieces of information about personal or factual

            details of a particular or identifiable natural person. This includes, for example, your name, your

            address, your e­mail address and your telephone number.</p>

        <p><strong>Scope of data collection, processing and use</strong></p>

        <p>Our web pages, do not record “click path” or similar user activity information, nor do they use

            cookies. In order to visit our Website, it is not necessary for you to provide us with any personal

            data (such as your name or your e­mail address).

            The service can only process images that are already openly accessible on the web. A copy of the

            image is stored by the system, alongside its analysis information (metadata, tampering localization

            maps etc). However, this information cannot be accessed from other users unless they provide the

            service with a URL pointing to an exact copy of the image file. Thus, if an exact copy of the same

            file is available elsewhere on the web, the same analysis data will be recalled from the database

            and shown to any user that submits its URL. Furthermore, gaining access to the URL of a report

            also gives access to the originally submitted image URL, and thus may lead to acquiring the

            submitted image as well.

            If you provide us with personal data, we collect, process and use this information only for the

            purposes of providing the Website and the services available on the Website.

            Personal data is only shared with public authorities and government institutions when this is

            stipulated by law, or when we are forced to do so by a court of law. Our staff and any service

            providers we work with are bound to confidentiality and to observing the applicable data

            protection regulations.</p>

        <p><strong>Contact</strong></p>

        <p>You can use the contact e­mail provided on our Website to contact us directly or to request current

            information from us. We collect, process and use the information you provide in a contact form

            exclusively to handle your request.</p>

        <p><strong>Right of access and questions about data protection</strong></p>

        <p>Under the applicable data protection regulations, you have the right to free access to any of your

            personal data that is stored. You can revoke your consent to collect, process and use data at any

            time, with effectiveness for the future.

            We are happy to answer any further questions on data protection and processing of your personal

            data. You can contact us at <span>verifymedia@iti.gr</span></p>
